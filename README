NAME
    MATH::simpleRNG - simple Random Number Generator

SYNOPSIS
      use Math::simpleRNG qw (sRNG);
      $random = sRNG('seed1','seed2');

DESCRIPTION
    This function uses George Marsaglia's Multiply With Carry algorithm to
    produce uniformly distributed unsigned integers.

    * $random = sRNG('seed1','seed2')
          input:        seed1   [optional]
                        seed2   [optional]

          return:       an unsigned random integer 1 -> 2^32 -1

          Starting from a known set of non-zero seeds, the RNG
          will return a repeating set of pseudo random numbers.

          You may alter the pattern by periodically supplying 
          additional seed(s). If no seed is supplied or the seed
          integer portion of the seed is zero, system time() is
          used to seed the algorithm.

        Note: for smaller numbers, i.e. 3-4 digit

          my $num = sRNG int(sRNG()/5000000);
